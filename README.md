# Vitality
Vitality is an operating system designed to empower home users to host their own services, perform their own backups, and be in *complete control* of their data (keep it *out* of the corperate cloud). Vitality aims to help users save time in setting up, configuring, and maintaining decentialized personal "cloud" systems. This will help users become less dependent on centrally controlled systems and more fluent in using distributed, decentralized approaches to service and file hosting.

Built on the flexibility of Gentoo Linux, Vitality provides a structure that is readily able to perform the tasks required for Digital Survival. Using the power of Portage, Vitality maintains the ability to be easily adapted to the needs of each user.
