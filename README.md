# Vitality
Vitality is an operating system designed to empower home users to host their own services, do their own backups, and be in complete control of their data (keep it out of the cloud. Vitality aims to help users save time in setting up, configuring, and maintaining such systems. This will help users become less dependent on centrally controlled systems and more fluent in using distributed, decentralized approaches to service and file hosting.

Built on the flexibility of Gentoo Linux, Vitality provides a pre-configured structure that is readily able to perform the tasks of Digital Survival. Since the Portage system is used for packaging Vitality maintains the ability to be adapted to the needs of each user.
