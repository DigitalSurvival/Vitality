# \/itality

\/itality is new Linux operating system designed to empower users to host their own services, perform their own backups, and be in *complete control* of their data. Users should have an easy method of keeping their data *out* of the corporate cloud and *into* a self-hosted, distributed cloud. Become less dependent on centrally controlled systems and more independent using distributed, decentralized approaches to services and file hosting!

Vitality helps users save time in setting up, configuring, and maintaining decentralized personal "cloud" systems. Built on the flexibility of Gentoo Linux, Vitality provides a structure that is readily able to perform the tasks required for [Digital Survival](http://www.digitalsurvival.org/). Using the power of Portage, Vitality maintains the ability to be easily adapted to the needs of each user.

Note: Vitality is a work in progress.
