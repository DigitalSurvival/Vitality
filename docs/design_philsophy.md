Vitality Linux
---------------

Vitality is a lightweight Gentoo-based Linux distribution with a focus on ARM archetectures (raspberry PI, Orange PI, CHIP, etc.), however x86 and amd64 editions will also be avaiable. 

### Security

A primary concern of the Digital Survival project is security, therefore Vitality will be audited often and pre-configured to use strict security policies.


### Components 

Vitality is composed of:

1. The Linux Kernel
2. Systemd
3. Portage
4. Btrfs (to easily create large storage pools)

The kernel configuration file are managed by Digital Survival so that live patching can actually happen. This is an opt-in or opt-out selection.
